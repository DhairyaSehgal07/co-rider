### The challenge

The application should implement the usual behaviour of any chat application on your phone i.e., open the most recent chat message and when scrolled above a certain threshold it should make a call to above API by incrementing the page number to retrieve older chats. However, there is no need to update the chat headers on subsequent hits.
